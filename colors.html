            <h2 class ="Title">Explanation</h2>
            <h3 class ="Title">Now what you see is a demonstration of colors, that i made with the new stuff i learned in freecodecamp.
                 Even though i struggled with it quite a bit, i finally managed to understand and learn it.
                 Now the question is ... how have i did it? easy to explain.
                 I created divs to style my backgrounds. I made a container that contains all the divs i put under the main div. 
                 In the css data i made, i have colored the container to black so and gave it its height and width so it is visible.
                     I made marker divs for the colors i wanted to code, gave a good hight and width, then i did it with green, blue so on.
                 To color styles(divs) you can use RGB/RGBA which means Red Green Blue/alpha numbers,you can use this[#00FF1E] which is rather 
                 complicated but a little bit easy to understand The first two are for red. 1 for color 2 for tone, the 3rd and 4rth for green.
                 3 for green and 4 for tone. And the last 2 blue. 5 for color 6 for tone. Or hls which means, hue, saturation and lightness.
                 To make the colors look more good, i use linear-gradient. This allows to add 2 more colors to one color. I recommend using rgb().
                 The first RGB() is the first color, the second RGB() is the color in the middle and the last RGB is the last color, you can't use more than 3. 
                 Now then i made 2 lines for the colors to make them look like markers. To use 2 lines use double. Add width and height to see it.
                 You set the width and height in the Marker class. the width for the marker lines can only be changed in border-line, where you also color the lines.
                 Once i made the Lines i added a shadow for the background. Now don't get confused because the shadow for the markers need to be in the 
                 marker class to work, but the height and padding for the shadow needs to be in a sepearte class. I made a class called Silk for it.
                 Oddly the marker and the shadow would move with the markers, so i seperated them with the markers. 
                 To do that i make a new class to connect 2 with one, so i connect class Silk and Class markers and say that i want the Display 
                 to seperate markers and the shadow in order to move them as i like. And there you have it.
